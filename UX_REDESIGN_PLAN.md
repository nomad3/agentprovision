# AgentProvision UX Redesign for Business Users

**Goal**: Make AgentProvision intuitive for non-technical business people

**Date**: October 30, 2025

---

## 🎯 Current UX Analysis

### ❌ Pain Points Identified

**1. Information Overload**
- 11 menu items in sidebar (too many!)
- Technical jargon everywhere
  - "Data Pipelines" → What's a pipeline?
  - "Vector Stores" → What's that?
  - "Connectors" → Too technical
  - "Deployments" → Confusing

**2. No Clear User Journey**
- Dashboard shows metrics but no path to create them
- Empty pages are just stubs (Notebooks, Pipelines)
- No onboarding or getting started flow
- No guidance on what to do first

**3. Technical Focus**
- Built for data engineers, not business users
- Assumes technical knowledge
- No contextual help or explanations
- Complex workflows hidden behind simple buttons

**4. Poor Information Architecture**
- AI features scattered (Agents, Agent Kits, Chat separate)
- Data features mixed (Datasets, Data Sources, Data Pipelines)
- Unclear hierarchy

**5. Missing Business Context**
- Fake/demo data in dashboard
- No connection to actual business outcomes
- Metrics don't tell a story
- No actionable insights

## 🎨 UX Redesign Strategy

### 1. **Simplify Navigation** (3 Main Sections)

**Instead of 11 items, group into 3 clear categories:**

```
📊 INSIGHTS (was: Dashboard, Analytics)
   - My Dashboard
   - Reports & Data
   - Business Metrics

🤖 AI ASSISTANT (was: Agents, Agent Kits, Chat)
   - Ask AI
   - AI Assistants
   - AI Tools

⚙️ WORKSPACE (was: Everything else)
   - Settings
   - Data Sources
   - Team & Sharing
```

### 2. **Use Business Language**

| ❌ Technical Term | ✅ Business Term |
|-------------------|------------------|
| Datasets | Reports & Data |
| Data Pipelines | Automations |
| Vector Stores | Knowledge Base |
| Deployments | Published Apps |
| Connectors | Data Connections |
| Notebooks | Analysis Workbooks |
| Agent Kits | AI Templates |
| Tools | Integrations |

### 3. **Create Task-Oriented Workflows**

#### Home Dashboard: "What do you want to do?"

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Welcome back, Sarah! 👋                       │
│                                                 │

```
