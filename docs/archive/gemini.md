# ServiceTsunami: The Unified Data & AI Lakehouse Platform

ServiceTsunami is an enterprise-grade platform designed to bring together all your data, analytics, and AI workloads, much like a modern data lakehouse. It provides a unified environment for data engineering, data science, machine learning, and business intelligence, enabling seamless orchestration of AI agents across multi-cloud environments.

## Core Vision: A Data Lakehouse Approach

Inspired by the principles of a data lakehouse, ServiceTsunami combines the best aspects of data lakes (cost-effective storage, schema flexibility) with the best aspects of data warehouses (ACID transactions, data governance, performance). This architecture is ideal for handling diverse data types and enabling advanced analytics and AI workloads.

## Implementation Progress – Oct 20, 2025

- **Backend groundwork**
  - Added structured schema/service support for `AgentKit` simulations (`apps/api/app/schemas/agent_kit.py`, `apps/api/app/services/agent_kits.py`).
  - Introduced dataset ingestion models and services (`apps/api/app/models/dataset.py`, `apps/api/app/services/datasets.py`) along with chat session models (`apps/api/app/models/chat.py`).
  - Registered new routers and config (`apps/api/app/api/v1/routes.py`, `apps/api/app/core/config.py`) and pinned ingestion dependencies (`apps/api/requirements.txt`).
- **Next steps**
  - Add FastAPI endpoints for dataset upload/preview and chat sessions.
  - Extend seed data/migrations, then wire frontend upload workflow and chat UI.

## Key Capabilities & Features

### 1. Unified Data & AI Workloads

ServiceTsunami offers a single, integrated platform for the entire data and AI lifecycle:

*   **Data Engineering & ETL:** Build and manage reliable data pipelines to ingest, transform, and process data from any source. Support for various data formats (structured, semi-structured, unstructured) and real-time streaming capabilities.
*   **Data Science & Machine Learning:** An end-to-end platform for the entire machine learning lifecycle, from experimentation and model development to training, deployment, and monitoring. Leverage collaborative notebooks for iterative development.
*   **SQL Analytics & BI:** Run high-performance SQL queries directly on your data lake. Build interactive dashboards and reports to visualize data and extract business intelligence, supporting both traditional and AI-driven analytics.

### 2. Advanced AI Agent Orchestration

Go beyond traditional ML models with robust AI agent management:

*   **Multi-cloud Agent Deployment:** Deploy and manage AI agents seamlessly across various cloud providers, ensuring flexibility and avoiding vendor lock-in.
*   **Agent Lifecycle Management:** From development and testing to deployment and versioning, ServiceTsunami provides tools for comprehensive agent lifecycle management.
*   **Performance Monitoring & Optimization:** Monitor agent performance, resource utilization, and identify opportunities for optimization to ensure efficient and effective AI operations.

### 3. Enterprise-Grade Foundations

Built with enterprise requirements in mind, ServiceTsunami provides:

*   **Multi-tenant Control Plane:** Securely manage isolated tenants, AI agents, deployments, and users with JWT-secured APIs. Ensures data isolation and compliance for diverse organizational structures.
*   **Robust Authentication & Authorization:** Features like password hashing, token issuance, and role-based access control (RBAC) ensure secure access. Demo seed data facilitates instant evaluation and onboarding.
*   **Interactive Operator Console:** A protected dashboard offering live analytics, fleet overview, deployment status, and workspace settings for comprehensive operational visibility and control.
*   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Leverage Docker-compose for consistent local development and Terraform scaffolding for provisioning and managing infrastructure on major cloud platforms (e.g., AWS EKS, Aurora, S3).

### 4. Collaborative Environment

*   **Collaborative Notebooks:** Work together in real-time on notebooks for data exploration, analysis, and model building. Share insights, code, and results seamlessly across teams.

## Roadmap Ideas

To further enhance the platform, future plans include:

*   **OAuth/SAML SSO Integration:** Integrate with enterprise identity providers (Okta, Azure AD) for seamless single sign-on.
*   **Agent Creation Wizards & Evaluation Dashboards:** Develop intuitive wizards for agent creation, comprehensive evaluation dashboards, and visual editors for advanced AI workflows (e.g., LangGraph).
*   **Expanded Observability:** Connect OpenTelemetry traces to Grafana dashboards and expose FinOps insights via cost APIs for deeper monitoring and cost management.
*   **Automated Deployments:** Implement GitHub Actions for automated deployments to managed environments (EKS/GKE) utilizing Terraform modules.

ServiceTsunami is the foundation for building next-generation agent lifecycle management, multi-tenant security, and infrastructure automation across enterprise environments, empowering organizations to harness the full potential of their data and AI assets.
