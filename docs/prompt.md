## üß© **AGENTPROVISION MASTER PROMPT (SYSTEM DEFINITION)**

```
SYSTEM NAME: AgentProvision Orchestrator
VERSION: v1.0
AUTHOR: Simon Aguilera
PURPOSE:
AgentProvision is an enterprise-grade, multi-tenant orchestration platform for AI agents, designed to manage data workflows, automation, and cognitive operations across business and personal ecosystems. It integrates Temporal, DataLake infrastructure, APIs, and AI reasoning to create adaptive agent networks capable of learning from user data and optimizing processes autonomously.

---
## üß≠ CORE PRINCIPLES
1. **Autonomy:** Each agent operates with clear purpose, local memory, and ability to request actions or data from other agents.
2. **Orchestration over Isolation:** Agents communicate through the shared Orchestrator layer, not via direct calls.
3. **Data-Centric:** Every interaction, log, and event feeds the unified AgentProvision DataLake.
4. **Security & Privacy:** All tenants (businesses, individuals) are sandboxed; data never crosses tenants.
5. **Feedback Loops:** Continuous measurement of results ‚Üí model refinement ‚Üí behavior tuning.

---
## üß† ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW
### CORE COMPONENTS:
- **SchedulerAgent:** Manages Temporal or Cron workflows across agents.
- **DataAgent:** Handles ETL to the DataLake (S3 + Postgres + DuckDB).
- **IntegrationAgent:** Connects third-party APIs (Google, Slack, Stripe, AWS, etc.).
- **InsightAgent:** Uses LLMs to summarize, analyze, and generate insights.
- **CoachAgent:** Converts insights into actions, routines, or advice.
- **NotificationAgent:** Communicates through Telegram, Slack, WhatsApp, or Email.
- **UserInterfaceAgent:** Renders dashboards, Notion embeds, or API responses.
- **AuditAgent:** Tracks logs, streaks, metrics, and human feedback.

---
## ‚öôÔ∏è EXECUTION MODES
- **BusinessOps Mode:** For corporate tenants (BI, FinOps, DevOps, AIOps).
- **LifeOps Mode:** For individuals ‚Äî discipline, health, journaling, energy, purpose.
- **Hybrid Mode:** Cross-domain data models for founder or executive profiles.

---
## üß© DEFAULT TENANTS
1. **AgentProvision Core (System Tenant)**
   - Handles admin operations, registry, and agent deployments.

2. **Personal Mastery ERP (Simon Aguilera)**
   - Subsystem: LifeOps
   - Agents: SchedulerAgent, JournalAgent, FocusAgent, HealthAgent, InsightAgent, CoachAgent, NotificationAgent
   - Goal: Optimize discipline, health, focus, and energy using AI workflows and Tao-inspired feedback.

3. **Client Tenants** (Banco Falabella, Integral, EventBridge, Silvercreek, etc.)
   - BusinessOps workflows: FinOps dashboards, data orchestration, AI automation, reporting pipelines.

## üîÅ WORKFLOW EXAMPLES

**MorningRoutineWorkflow (LifeOps):**
1. Trigger at 07:00 ‚Üí JournalAgent ‚Üí create daily entry prompt.
2. InsightAgent ‚Üí analyze previous data ‚Üí recommend today‚Äôs top priority.
3. CoachAgent ‚Üí deliver message via NotificationAgent (Telegram).
4. SchedulerAgent ‚Üí check Calendar (IntegrationAgent) ‚Üí suggest focus block.
5. DataAgent ‚Üí log all actions to DataLake.

**FinOpsDashboardWorkflow (BusinessOps):**
1. Pull cost + metrics from AWS, Azure, GCP APIs.
2. DataAgent ‚Üí normalize into DWH schema.
3. InsightAgent ‚Üí detect anomalies, trends, or savings opportunities.
4. CoachAgent ‚Üí send summarized report to C-level dashboard and Slack.

---
## üìö KNOWLEDGE & MEMORY
- Every tenant has its own vector store (ChromaDB / Pinecone) indexed by embeddings of all text and logs.
- InsightAgent retrieves historical data for context-aware recommendations.
- Optional LLM fine-tuning per tenant (low-rank adapter / RAG config).

---
## üåê CONNECTORS
- Google Calendar, Gmail, Sheets, Docs
- Slack, Telegram, WhatsApp
- Stripe, HubSpot, Salesforce
- AWS, Azure, GCP Billing APIs
- Notion, Airtable, Supabase

## üìä DATA SCHEMA TEMPLATE
```

user_profiles (id, name, timezone, preferences)
journal_entries (date, wins, lesson, energy, gratitude[], priority, note)
focus_sessions (project, start, end, outcome)
energy_logs (sleep_quality, energy, productivity, notes)
habits (name, timestamp, value)
integrations (platform, token, refresh_token, scopes)

## üöÄ DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS (for Windsurf)
- Paste this entire prompt into the **System Definition / Root Context** of Windsurf.
- Then feed tenant-specific prompts (like ‚ÄúPersonal Mastery ERP‚Äù use case) as child configurations.
- Ensure Temporal, Postgres, and Telegram credentials are live in environment variables.
